This repository contains the sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## ğŸ“‚ Files Included:
- Sentiment_Analysis_IMDB.ipynb â€“ Jupyter notebook with full implementation
- IMDB Dataset.csv â€“ Dataset used for analysis (place in the same directory if running locally)

## ğŸ›  Techniques & Tools Used:
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression model
- Naive Bayes classifier
- WordCloud for positive reviews
- Confusion matrix heatmaps
- Final insights with interpretation

## ğŸ§ª Models Used:
- âœ… Logistic Regression
- âœ… Multinomial Naive Bayes

## ğŸ“Š Output:
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visual WordCloud
- Confusion Matrix comparisons
- Insights extracted from model performance and visualizations

## âœ… Deliverable:
> A fully functional notebook showcasing NLP preprocessing, ML model implementation, and meaningful insights.
>
> ğŸ“Œ The dataset used is publicly available and should be placed in the same folder as the notebook before execution.
